SbPlugin
========
In this joint operation we express our efforts to bring SpaceBukkit back to a presentable state. This repo, along with [SbRTK](https://github.com/Antariano/SbRTK) and [SbRTK](https://github.com/Antariano/SbRTK) represent a complete rewrite of our java core files that will ultimately become SpaceBukkit 1.3.

We encourage any developer to help us out with issues and pull requests.
